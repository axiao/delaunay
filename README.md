delaunay
========
A Delaunay triangulator.

Uses the quad-edge datastructure for planar subdivisions described in a paper
by Guibas and Stolfi, 
_Primitives for the Manipulation of General Subdivisions and the Computation of 
Voronoi Diagrams_, ACM Transactions on Graphics 4(2):74â€“123, April 1985
as well as the divide and conquer algorithm for computing Delaunay 
triangulations (described in the same paper).

building
--------
You can compile everything using GNU `make` to create an executable called 
`delaunay`.

usage
-----
__delaunay__ uses the [.node](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.node.html) 
and [.ele](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.ele.html) file formats from 
Shewchuk's [Triangle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html).

It takes in a file with suffix .node and outputs a similarly named file with
suffix .ele, in the formats described on the Triangle pages.
The actual triangulations (.ele) are viewable using the Show Me visualization 
program included with Triangle.

A common invocation will be:
> `>> delaunay foo.node`

Please use the help option to see the other possible command line options.
> `>> delaunay -h`

Almost all of the test cases are from a

[Computational Geometry](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/274/) 
class at UC Berkeley (CS274).
